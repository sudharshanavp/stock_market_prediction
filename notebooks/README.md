## Jupyter Notebooks Files

All raw/protyped codes are to be stored in jupyter notebooks until they work as intended. Once we get satisfying results in the notebooks we port the code to thier own respective python files as needed.

Each notebook have their own purpose as follows:

* tweet_parse.ipynb: to test parsing of tweets related to a particular stock.

* news_parse.ipynb: To test various news api for parsing headlines and news data.

* sentiment_analysis.ipynb: To test various nlp libraries for sentiment analysis.

* ml_algorithms.ipynb: For testing supervised learning algorithms.

* nueral_networks.ipynb: For testing nueral networks.
